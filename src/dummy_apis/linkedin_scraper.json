The concept discussed here is based on the book "Atomic Habits" by James Clear. In the book, the author presents a rule for breaking a habit which suggests making it challenging to continue the habit. This means adding obstacles or barriers that make it challenging for individuals to engage in the habit. By doing so, people can reduce the likelihood of engaging in the habit and eventually break free from it. This solution is effective because it requires individuals to be intentional and try to overcome the barriers, thus making it harder to fall back into the habit. In summary, the idea is to make it challenging to continue a habit in order to eliminate it entirely.',
