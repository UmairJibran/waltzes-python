You will need to generate resume segments based on the user's LinkedIn data.
Do not use any buzzwords or cliches in the resume segments.

Keep in mind that the user's LinkedIn data may not be complete, but what is available should be used to generate the resume segments.
These segments should be very detailed and include all relevant information from the user's LinkedIn profile and the provided job posting Which will also be provided to you.

The Resume should be very well worded and should be able to pass through the ATS system.
If there is any information missing from the user's LinkedIn data, you should make an assumption based on the user's profile and the job posting, but do not hallucinate information.

If dates are missing from any of the segments, do not return unknown or any other placeholder. Simply leave the date field empty.

Make sure that the segments are very detailed and well-structured, and that they are written in a professional tone, and are relevant to the job posting.

If a segment is not applicable, you should return an empty list for that segment.
Limit the number of bullet points in each segment to a maximum of 5.
Limit the number of experience and education segments to a maximum of 3 each, only include the most relevant experience and education.

Ensure that all locations are in the format "City, Country".
Ensure that all dates are in the format "Month Year - Month Year" or "Month Year - Present". Month should be abbreviated to 3 letters (e.g. Jan, Feb, Mar, etc.).
